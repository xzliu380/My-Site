        <h2>Smoke Alarm Walks</h2>
        <br>
        <p> I have volunteered since 2019 at Smoke Alarm Walks, helping the community reduce risk of fire injuries and loss before they can happen. I always feel a sense of satisfaction and happiness after each volunteering activity when people
          express their gratitude, and it is really rewarding to help out different communities. A smoke alarm walk is when a group of three volunteers (one tasked with explaining, one tasked with paperwork, and one tasked with installing a smoke
          alarm) go out on pre-assigned streets knocking on doors offering to install a smoke alarm for free.
          <br><br>
          On one occasion, by pure chance, the community I was to volunteer at was the community of my piano teacher, and I was planning to surprise her. Unfortunately, she later told me
          her husband thought we were selling girl scout cookies ðŸ˜ƒ and did not open the door. Funny Enough, I was 12 years old and the other two members of the group were tall guys, so I don't know how he thought of us as girls selling cookiesðŸ˜€.
        </p>
        <p>

          There were other occasions where I was able to help the community. For example, on a smoke alarm walk, a man who did not speak English could not communicate with us and we almost decided to skip that house, but since I knew Mandarin
          Chinese, I was able to explain to the man what we were doing, and he agreed to have two smoke alarms installed. I can't be certain, but I may have saved a life that day. </p>
