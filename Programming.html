        <h2>Discord Bot Project</h2>
        <br>
        <p>My first completed programing project, a Discord Bot, is a way for people to elect leaders and vote on other matters in their group chats on Discord. This project was inspired from arguments in my own group chat, which is why I decided to
          make a public bot.</p>
